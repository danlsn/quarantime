How did you spend your quarantime?

## Description

As I'm writing this (11th of October 2021) I'm sitting at my computer in Melbourne, Australia under Lockdown. On the whole Australia has done pretty well during the pandemic due to some very strong Public Health measures and the fortunate reality of being an Island Nation.
But, this has led to some of the longest lockdowns in the World. At this time, Melbourne has spent the most cumulative days in lockdown of any city in the world.

As the world grappled with Coronavirus in early-2020, Australia went into a national lockdown as did many other parts of the world. Life as we know it completely changed, and we all found new and novel ways of spending our time.
Seemingly overnight our behaviours and routines changed as we adjusted to a 'new normal.'

This project is my attempt at collecting, organising, visualising and understanding how I spent my time in quarantine.

## Why?
There are two main reasons I'm taking on this project.
1. If you asked me how much time I spent doing certain activities, how much I slept or exercised, how much I volunteered, or how much I drove my car; _I wouldn't be able to give you an accurate answer._
2. My desire to understand how I spend my time has motivated me to learn Data Analytics. It's pushed me to _finally_ learn how to code, and hopefully it's going to help me make a meaningful change to my career.
